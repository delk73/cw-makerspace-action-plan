# Food Model Blueprint

## Purpose
Outline the integration of food-truck partners, public health compliance, and outdoor commons design within the makerspace campus.

## Food-Truck Integration
- Curate a rotating roster of local vendors aligned with youth-friendly, affordable offerings.
- Structure revenue-sharing agreements that support operations while incentivizing vendor consistency.
- Provide shared utilities (power, greywater access) with clearly documented maintenance responsibilities.

## Health Code Simplification
- Engage Clark County Public Health early to clarify permitting pathways for mobile units and shared prep spaces.
- Maintain a checklist for inspections, temperature logging, and waste handling.
- Train staff and volunteers on food safety boundaries between makerspace operations and vendor responsibilities.

## Outdoor Commons Design
- Allocate a dedicated pad with weather protection, seating, and safe pedestrian flow between shops and food zone.
- Incorporate lighting, signage, and sound controls to balance activation with nearby residents.
- Pair programming (open mics, demo days) with food service windows to encourage cross-pollination of audiences.
