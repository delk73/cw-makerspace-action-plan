# Food Integration Model

**Purpose:** Outline the strategy for integrating food-truck operations, simplifying health code compliance, and shaping the outdoor commons.

## Rationale
- Food offerings catalyze social cohesion during programs and events.
- Mobile vendors reduce capital expenditure compared to fixed commercial kitchens.
- Partnership with trusted operators supports local entrepreneurs and cross-promotes makerspace activities.

## Health Code Simplification Strategy
- Pursue agreements with pre-licensed food trucks to minimize direct health permit obligations.
- Maintain clear separation between fabrication zones and food service area with posted signage and barriers.
- Coordinate routine inspections with county health officials and document outcomes in `ops/PERMIT_MATRIX.md`.

## Outdoor Commons Design Principles
- Allocate dedicated pad with power, gray-water containment, and waste management stations.
- Provide weather-protected seating, communal tables, and demonstration space for outdoor workshops.
- Integrate lighting, security cameras, and ADA-compliant pathways linking facility entrances to the commons.

## Vendor Integration Plan
- Develop rotating vendor schedule synced with high-traffic workshop times and community events.
- Offer revenue-sharing or stipend options aligned with sponsorship commitments.
- Create shared calendar and onboarding packet outlining service expectations and makerspace values.

## Next Actions
- Identify top three local food trucks with strong community reputation and accessible menus.
- Draft template agreements covering schedule, fees, utilities, and joint marketing.
- Pilot weekend maker market with curated vendors to test flow, utilities, and visitor feedback.
