# Camas–Washougal Makerspace Overview

## Mission
The Camas–Washougal Makerspace exists to cultivate hands-on creativity, workforce pathways, and community resilience by providing shared tools, training, and collaborative programs.

## Context
The initiative is in the pre-launch planning phase, aligning local educators, industry partners, and civic leaders around a single nonprofit platform. This repository seeds the canonical documentation set that will guide fundraising, facility planning, and team formation.

## Current Phase Summary
- Establish legal and governance scaffolding for a Washington nonprofit.
- Build a recruitment pipeline for core leadership roles across operations, programs, finance, fabrication, communications, and vision.
- Coordinate outreach to funders, donors, and community champions while validating facility and permit requirements.
- Prepare modular documentation so contributors can rapidly extend workstreams in later phases.
