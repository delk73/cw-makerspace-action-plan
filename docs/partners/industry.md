### Notes
- Keep priority markers consistent (ðŸ”´ High / ðŸŸ  Medium / ðŸŸ¢ Low).  
- Each partner should have a clear **next actionable step** rather than generic intent.  
- Updates must include `lastUpdated` in front-matter for traceability.  
- Add new rows below existing onesâ€”alphabetical by name for stability.
