### Notes
- Treat this as a single **people-pipeline** map (education â†’ community â†’ workforce).  
- Maintain sub-tags in a `tags:` column later if you want to filter (e.g., `tags: ["K-12", "Library", "Civic Club"]`).  
- Keep language accessible for non-technical partners; this file doubles as your public outreach sheet.
