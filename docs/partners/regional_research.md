### Notes
- This tier positions the makerspace as a **regional applied R&D node**.  
- Focus on partnership MoUs that yield shared equipment access or training modules.  
- Each partner should have a defined outcome: joint workshop, grant submission, or talent exchange.  
- Keep summary metrics (active MoUs, pending proposals, events attended) at the top of the file when updating.
