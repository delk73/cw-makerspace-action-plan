# Facility Planning Outline

**Purpose:** Summarize zoning, spatial layout, utilities, and food-truck pad integration considerations for the makerspace site.

## Zoning and Permitting
- Confirm light industrial or mixed-use zoning compatibility with fabrication and assembly activities.
- Map conditional use permits, occupancy limits, and noise ordinances.
- Coordinate with city planning office for pre-application meetings and align with `ops/PERMIT_MATRIX.md`.

## Space Program
- Core fabrication bays: wood, metal, digital fabrication, and clean prototyping zones.
- Support spaces: classrooms, collaboration lounge, materials storage, and admin nook.
- Public interface: reception, gallery wall, retail micro-shop, and outdoor commons access.

## Utilities and Infrastructure
- Electrical: three-phase power for heavy equipment, dedicated circuits, emergency shutoffs.
- HVAC and Ventilation: dust collection, fume extraction, and climate control per zone.
- Water and Waste: utility sinks, gray-water management, and compliant waste disposal contracts.

## Food-Truck Pad Interface
- Position pad adjacent to outdoor commons with direct power and lighting.
- Ensure traffic flow maintains safe separation between vehicles and pedestrian pathways.
- Integrate signage, queuing, and waste stations to support events and daily operations.

## Phasing Considerations
- Phase 1: Pop-up modules using mobile equipment and temporary storage.
- Phase 2: Pilot lease build-out with partial tool deployment and office hub.
- Phase 3: Full build-out with dedicated classrooms, expanded fabrication, and outdoor commons enhancements.

## Risk and Mitigation Notes
- Document insurance requirements and inspection schedules.
- Track supply chain lead times for equipment and finish materials.
- Engage accessibility consultant to ensure ADA compliance across phases.
