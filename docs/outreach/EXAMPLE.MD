Subject: Camas–Washougal Makerspace — Empowering Builders and Creative Learners

Hi [Name or Team],

I hope you are doing well. I lead the Camas-Washougal Makerspace initiative - a nonprofit community hub where youth, educators, and local innovators collaborate on hands-on projects across hardware, fabrication, and emerging technologies.

Our mission is to make advanced creative tools and mentorship accessible to all. Over the next year, we’re activating a pilot facility, launching STEAM and fabrication programs, and building a sustainable sponsorship and grant stack to keep access equitable.

We’d love to share our roadmap and explore ways to collaborate with [Organization Name] - whether through partnership, grant alignment, or knowledge exchange. Could we schedule a short conversation in the coming weeks to discuss opportunities?

Thank you for the work you do to empower builders and creative communities - we’d be grateful to connect.

Best,
[Your Name]
Camas–Washougal Makerspace
