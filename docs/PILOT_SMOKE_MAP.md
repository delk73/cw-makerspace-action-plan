# üß≠ Makerspace Smoke Map  
**Purpose:** Rapidly identify and classify friction points to guide go/adapt/pivot decisions during the pilot phase (first 6‚Äì8 weeks).

| # | Friction Point | Category *(Ops / Legal / Human / Financial / Technical)* | Description / Evidence | Fixability *(Low = structural, High = tactical)* | Quick Fix Option | Long-Term Strategy | Decision / Owner | Linked Issues / Docs |
|---|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Example: Zoning ambiguity on light fabrication | Legal | City planning flagged unclear ‚Äúoffice use.‚Äù | ‚ö†Ô∏è Low | Apply for temporary occupancy variance | Relocate or lobby for mixed-use inclusion | Alex | #ZON-01 |
| 2 | Example: Volunteers inconsistent | Human | 4/10 confirmed no-shows for setup weekend | üü° Medium | Add shifts + incentives | Hire part-time ops lead | Jamie | #OPS-03 |
| 3 | Example: HVAC inadequate for soldering area | Technical | Airflow < spec; heat buildup | üî¥ High | Add portable fan units | Budget retrofit in Q2 | Pat | #FAC-02 |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

## üîÑ Weekly Sync Template
Use this at the end of each week to turn observations into action:

- **Top 3 friction points:**  
- **Top 3 fixes in progress:**  
- **Key decision for next week:**

## üß© How to Use
- **Log continuously:** Record every friction point‚Äîdon‚Äôt triage early.  
- **Weekly triage:** Rank by *fixability* and *impact*; address top items each sprint.  
- **Decision checkpoints:**  
  - Week 4 ‚Üí Identify fixable vs. structural friction.  
  - Week 8 ‚Üí Decide: go / adapt / relocate.  
- **Keep lightweight:** Google Sheet or Notion board is fine; color-code by category.

### Legend
‚ö†Ô∏è Low fixability ‚Äî likely structural  
üü° Medium ‚Äî requires coordination  
üî¥ High ‚Äî quick tactical fix

## üß≠ Retrospective Summary
After each pilot cycle, summarize what was learned and what changed:
- **Top friction themes resolved:**  
- **Structural blockers:**  
- **Validated strengths:**  
- **Next actions:**

## ‚úÖ Outcome
A living friction map that turns uncertainty into data to decide fit and investment with evidence instead of assumptions.
