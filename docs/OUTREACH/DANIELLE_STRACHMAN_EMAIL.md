Subject: Camas–Washougal Makerspace: Youth Innovation Hub Backed by Community Builders

Hi Danielle,

I hope you are well! I’m part of the founding team behind the Camas–Washougal Makerspace, a nonprofit prototyping campus emerging from the Gorge Maker Network community. We are building a youth-forward hub that blends fabrication labs, startup experimentation, and outdoor commons anchored by a food-truck program.

We admire how 1517 Fund champions ambitious builders, and we believe our launch plan—focused on STEAM pathways for rural and suburban youth—aligns well with your thesis. We are currently assembling our founding board, finalizing site control, and raising a $350K blended capital stack to open doors within 12 months.

Could we schedule a 30-minute call in the next two weeks to share our deck and explore fit? I would also value your perspective on which 1517-backed founders we should meet as potential advisors.

Thanks for considering the conversation, and I look forward to comparing notes.

Warmly,
[Your Name]
Camas–Washougal Makerspace
