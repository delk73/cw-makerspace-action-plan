Subject: Camas–Washougal Makerspace — Catalyzing Youth Builders in the Gorge

Hi Danielle,

I hope you are doing well. I lead the Camas–Washougal Makerspace initiative, and our team is building a nonprofit hub where young builders, educators, and founders can collaborate on hardware, biotech, and creative fabrication projects.

We are inspired by the 1517 ethos of backing ambitious learners and would value your perspective on our launch plan. Over the next 12 months we are activating a pilot facility, delivering STEAM and fabrication programs, and layering a grant and sponsorship stack that keeps access equitable.

Could we schedule a 30-minute conversation to share our roadmap, explore alignment with 1517 Fund, and gather feedback on potential fellowships or catalytic support? I have attached a one-page brief and would love to connect in the coming weeks.

Thank you for the work you do to champion builders — looking forward to hearing from you.

Best,
[Your Name]
Camas–Washougal Makerspace
