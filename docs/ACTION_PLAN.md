# Integrated Action Plan

## Purpose
Provide a deterministic roadmap that balances personal fit, community fit, and operational execution for the makerspace launch, reflecting the October 2025 synthesis workshop.

## Personal Fit Alignment
- Clarify founder and steward commitments, including availability, scope, and wellbeing checkpoints.
- Map individual strengths to priority initiatives, ensuring no critical function depends on a single person.
- Establish quarterly reflection cadences to reassess alignment and prevent burnout.

## Community Fit Alignment
- Document stakeholder segments: students, entrepreneurs, hobbyists, educators, and civic partners.
- Define feedback rituals (listening sessions, surveys, pilot events) that inform program and facility decisions.
- Track equity considerations, ensuring access for historically underserved residents in the Camasâ€“Washougal region.

## Operational Alignment
- Sequence pre-launch milestones: incorporation, bylaws approval, initial fundraising, site control, and pilot programming.
- Maintain cross-functional dependency map linking governance, facilities, programs, and funding tasks.
- Adopt lightweight project management rhythms (biweekly standups, monthly retros) to keep volunteers synchronized.

## Near-Term Priorities
1. Finalize governance documents and recruit founding board.
2. Publish role one-pagers and launch targeted outreach.
3. Validate preferred facility options with zoning and permit authorities.
4. Prepare seed funding brief and schedule investor/donor meetings.
