# Integrated Action Plan

**Purpose:** Capture the Oct 2025 synthesis aligning personal fit, community alignment, and operational readiness for the makerspace.

## Alignment Pillars

### Personal Fit
- Founding team commits to 18-month service window with quarterly reflection checkpoints.
- Each steward maintains documented learning goals covering fabrication, facilitation, and governance literacy.
- Burnout safeguards include shared leadership rotations and monthly wellness retrospectives.

### Community Fit
- Conduct quarterly listening sessions with educators, small manufacturers, and youth mentors to refine programming priorities.
- Codify inclusion commitments: sliding-scale memberships, translation support, and intergenerational programming.
- Track community demand signals via waitlists, program surveys, and partnership MOUs.

### Operational Fit
- Establish phased facility readiness: temporary pop-up labs (Q1–Q2), pilot site lease (Q3), full build-out (Q4).
- Implement compliance roadmap covering zoning, safety training, insurance, and fiscal sponsorship transitions.
- Deploy integrated tracking dashboard linking budget burn, recruitment progress, and risk mitigation.

## Priority Workstreams
1. **Governance Formation:** Finalize bylaws, recruit founding board, and adopt COI and safety policies.
2. **Facility Activation:** Complete site feasibility, secure key permits, and commission core utilities upgrades.
3. **Program Pilots:** Run modular tool safety workshops and STEAM intro series to validate demand and instructor pipeline.
4. **Funding Stack:** Blend grants, sponsorships, and earned revenue pilots to support 12-month runway.
5. **Outreach & Story:** Launch coordinated communication plan across schools, local industry, and civic partners.

## Milestone Timeline (Oct 2025 – Sep 2026)
- **Q4 2025:** Incorporate nonprofit, secure fiscal sponsor, formalize founding board.
- **Q1 2026:** Sign pilot facility agreement, launch pop-up workshop series, close seed grants.
- **Q2 2026:** Complete safety certifications, onboard program fellows, initiate membership beta.
- **Q3 2026:** Transition to independent 501(c)(3) status, expand fabrication zones, evaluate sustainability metrics.

## Dependency Map
- Governance cadence informs recruitment focus and board-led fundraising commitments.
- Facility readiness dictates equipment procurement and workshop scheduling.
- Funding wins unlock phased hiring, expanded operating hours, and equipment modernization.

## Review Cadence
- Update this plan quarterly in alignment with board strategy sessions and community advisory input.
