# 🛠️ Camas–Washougal Makerspace · Smoke Plan

An inclusive, **barrier-free makerspace initiative** for the Camas–Washougal region — a community hub for fabrication, learning, and creative repair culture, designed for **total accessibility** across physical, sensory, and cognitive dimensions.  
This smoke plan defines the **6–8 week pilot** to test fit, surface friction early, and generate the evidence needed for a go, adapt, or relocate decision.

---

## 🌱 Mission & Ethos
To establish a **community-driven fabrication and learning space** that integrates technical skill-building, art, and systems thinking.  
Our guiding values remain: total accessibility, transparency, safety, and local partnership — caring equally for people, tools, and the shared space.

---

## 🔍 Smoke Test Objectives
- Validate community demand through lightweight programming and open feedback loops.  
- Stress-test legal, operational, and safety assumptions before committing to a long-term site.  
- Map real-world friction points to drive quick tactical fixes and inform long-term design.  
- Build a transparent decision rhythm and documentation habit from day one.

---

## 🧩 Friction Mapping Workflow
- **Primary artifact:** `docs/PILOT_SMOKE_MAP.md` — logs every friction point with category, evidence, and ease of resolution.  
- **Log continuously:** Capture issues during build days, outreach calls, and tool trials.  
- **Classify clearly:** Tag each entry as Ops, Legal, Human, Financial, or Technical.  
- **Assign ownership:** Every row has a name — accountability is the resolution mechanism.

## 🔁 Weekly Operating Rhythm

| Rhythm | Focus | Outputs |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Daily touchpoint** | Flag new friction, add to smoke map | Updated entries with evidence and owner |
| **Weekly sync** | Use the template in `docs/PILOT_SMOKE_MAP.md` | Top 3 friction points, fixes in progress, next key decision |
| **Bi-weekly retro** | Check burn rate, volunteer load, member feedback | Adjust programming and resource allocation |

---

## 🚦 Decision Gates
- **Week 4 Checkpoint:** Separate structural vs. fixable friction, assess resource runway, and confirm pilot scope.  
- **Week 6-8 Decision:** Present smoke-map findings and recommend go/adapt/relocate to the advisory group.  
- **Evidence Package:** Friction themes, mitigations, and validated strengths form the funder and city brief.

---

## 🧭 Roles and Ownership
- **Smoke Test Owner:** KK — keeps the map current and ensures follow-through.  
- **Ops / Safety Liaison:** Coordinates tool readiness, safety logs, and site access.  
- **Community Lead:** Manages outreach and volunteer feedback loops.  
- **Finance Point:** Tracks pilot budget and flags cashflow risk.  

Ownership listed in the smoke map table is the single source of truth.

## ⚙️ Immediate Actions
1. Populate friction rows 4–5 in `docs/PILOT_SMOKE_MAP.md`.  
2. Draft the two-page concept brief referencing pilot evidence for funders and civic partners.  
3. Schedule first four weekly syncs; circulate template to core team.  
4. Stand up lightweight field tracker (Sheet / Notion) mirroring smoke-map fields for quick updates.

---

## 📎 Supporting Docs
- `docs/PILOT_SMOKE_MAP.md` — canonical tracker and weekly sync template.  
- `docs/TEAM_FRAMEWORK.md` — team roles and volunteer pipeline *(in progress).*  
- `docs/BUDGET.md` — pilot budget and contingency triggers *(in progress).*  
- `docs/FACILITY_PLAN.md` — site needs, zoning, and safety checklist *(in progress).*

## 🌉 Phase Continuity
This smoke test is **Phase 1** of the broader 12-month build plan.  
Insights here directly shape the next phases: team formalization, facility lease, and community expansion.

---

## ❤️ Why It Matters
A makerspace is more than a workshop — it’s civic infrastructure for creativity and belonging.  
By surfacing real-world friction now, we ensure the permanent space grows from lived experience rather than speculation.
