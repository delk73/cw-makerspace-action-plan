Subject: Partner with the Camas–Washougal Makerspace Launch

Hi [Donor Name],

We are building the Camas–Washougal Makerspace—a community-driven hub for fabrication, STEAM education, and entrepreneurial exploration. Early partners like you will help activate a space where youth and adults can collaborate, learn, and launch.

We are inviting a select group of sponsors to underwrite our opening toolkit, including equipment, safety infrastructure, and scholarships. I would love to share our 3-page brief and discuss how your team could be highlighted as a founding champion.

Would you be open to a short conversation next week? I’m happy to work around your schedule.

Appreciatively,
[Your Name]
Development Team, Camas–Washougal Makerspace
